# ~Scoots~

## Company Description

~Scoots~ is a fictitious üõµ motor scooter rental company located on the island of Cozumel off the coast of Mexico in the western Caribbean Sea. This owner-operator company caters to locals, walk-in tourists, motor scooter enthusiasts, and cruise-based touring groups and partnerships.

The company has two physical rental locations on Cozumel. One is near the Playa del Carmen-Cozumel Ferry dock in el Centro de Cozumel and the other is near the Terminal Puerta Maya further south along the coast which caters to the cruise lines and patrons. The company promotes friendly and easy to rent services of motor scooters, jeeps, and side-by-sides ATVs.

The overall goal of the website project is to promote the rental services for those customers that like to do their homework before getting to the island and to provide information about the services, requirements, and rental process. The website should reflect the fun and carefree attitude of the island and the ability to escape the touristy western part of the island by exploring the vast coasts and inlets on the southern and eastern shores.
